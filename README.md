<h2 align="left">To create an attendance system using face recognition, you will need to follow these steps:</h2>
<br>

1. Set up the environment:
    * Install necessary libraries (e.g., OpenCV, dlib, face_recognition).
    * Prepare your hardware (camera or webcam).

2. Capture and store faces:
    * Capture images of individuals and label them with their names.
    * Store these images for future reference.

3. Face detection and recognition:
    * Use face detection to locate faces in real-time video feed.
    * Use face recognition to identify faces by comparing them with the stored images.

4. Record attendance:
    * Maintain a log of recognized faces with timestamps to track attendance.

5. User interface (optional):
    * Create a simple user interface to display attendance records.

<h3>
  This script covers the basic steps for setting up a face recognition-based attendance system. Make sure to have a directory named known_faces with subdirectories for each person containing their images. The script will capture video from the webcam, recognize faces, and
  log attendance in a CSV file.

  To run the script, ensure you have the required libraries installed:
</h2>
<br>
<h3>
  * pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy
